================================================

Thank you for downloading SubSynth!

VST3 Plugin Installation:
--------------------------
1. Copy the SubSynth.vst3 FOLDER (not just the files inside) to:
   C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\

2. If the VST3 folder doesn't exist, create it manually.

3. Restart your DAW (Digital Audio Workstation).

4. Rescan your plugin folders in your DAW if necessary.

CLAP Plugin Installation:
--------------------------
1. Copy the SubSynth.clap FILE to:
   C:\Program Files\Common Files\CLAP\

Troubleshooting:
----------------
- Make sure you have administrator privileges when copying files
- Some DAWs may require you to manually add these directories to their
  plugin search paths
- If plugins don't appear, check your DAW's plugin manager/settings
